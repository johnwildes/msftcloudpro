# Understanding the "Shelter-in-place"

So yesterday the IL Gov announced a "shelter-in-place" or stay at home order.  You can find more about that @[Sun-Times], @[NPR], and @[NBC].  You can see the actual [Governor's Order].

Key things

1. No gatherings of more than 10 people
2. Absolutely no travel by any means, unless deemed essential.  
3. NO travel in and out of the state unless it is to maintain "Essential Businesses and Operations and Minimum Basic Operations".

Essential Businesses and Operations

- Stores that sell groceries and Medicine
- Food, Beverage and cannabis production and agriculture
- Organizations that provide charitable and social services
- Media
- Gas stations, and businesses needed for transportation
- Financial institutions
- Hardware and supply stores

You can leave the house:

- For your health and safety, keeping in mind practicing social distancing, and the other key elements of personal protection.
- For necessary supplies and services
- For outdoor activity.  Playgrounds are closed
- For certain types of work in the Essential Business and Operations
- To take care of others

There's no mention of how this is enforced, but the Village of Addison has taken this stance:

`Village and Police Department will not interfere with residents who are behaving responsibly, and are continuing to help us manage through this serious, but short-term, situation.` [Mayor's Letter]

Keep in mind that the original orders to close bars, and restaurants came on the 15th, which was 5 days ago, during the lively press conference the Gov gave, when HIS orders were not followed [^1].  

There have been reports of National Guard Movement [^2] take them for what they're worth.  If the shelter-in-place / stay at home order gets less traction (hard to imagine since most everything is closed), I would expect to see some overt enforcement of the movement of traffic.  

Remember, no one can take care of you , but you.  Do what you must to keep you and your family safe, then check on your neighbors safely.  If you must move, move smartly and with a purpose.  Know the orders, and justify your movements accordingly.

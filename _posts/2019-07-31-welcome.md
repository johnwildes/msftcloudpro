Welcome
======

I'm John, this is my blog, there are many like it, but this one is mine ;) .  The thoughts and opinions and articles of work expressed here are my own, and NOT the opinions or thoughts of my employer. I am an Azure consultant with [10th Magnitude] in Chicago, IL.

This isn't my first blog though. My first blog I started 14 years ago, which is still live, is on blogspot.  It was during my first Navy reserve deployment to Kuwait with a group called NAVELSF FWD Bravo.  

I've had a few projects before that, some hosted on geocities and one that I used to earn a Microsoft SiteBuilder level 2 association. It's amazing to see how technology has changed over the past 2 decades.  I have a lot I want to share so I hope you'll put me on bookmark and come back often.  

My goal here is that you'd find something useful or helpful.  The site is evolving, and I'm learning more about hosting it as I go, which will be the subject of some posts in the near future. For now it is a basic jekyll [^1] static site hosted on an Azure storage account [^2],[^3]. It is currently deployed with Azure Pipelines [^4], and managed in an Azure DevOps git based repo [^5].  There's no ads, and there's no commenting (at the moment).  If you want to reach out to me, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn, or reach out on Twitter.

Thanks again for stopping by!
